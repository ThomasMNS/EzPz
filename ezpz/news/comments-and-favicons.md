Title: Comments and Favicons

Summary: I've finished adding comments and favicons. Click read more for the details. 

Sorry for the lack of update yesterday, I was in the process of adding a comments system. This has now been finished. 

I decided to use Disqus as the comments system. In my experience, Disqus is generally very popular. I've actually seen sites implement a custom comments system, and people ask them to move to Disqus instead as they prefer it - they must be doing something right. 

I've set Disqus to only load when a button is clicked, so the impacts on page load time should be minimal. If you're not interested in comments, they won't impact you. I've also enabled guest posting, so while you do need to provide an email address (unfortunately I can't change this), you won't need to register for a Disqus account. 

I really hope you enjoy the comments system. I know some sites have been moving away from comments in recent years, but I think having a sense of community on a site is great. I'll be responding to all messages as soon as I can, so please do feel free to ask questions, make suggestions, point out mistakes and anything else! 

Disqus does require JavaScript. For those who prefer to browse the web with JS disabled, I'll be adding some alternative contact methods in the coming days (probably a contact form and email address) so you can still get in touch. 

In other news, I've finally added favicons. I've used the awesome [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net), so the icons should look good across all browsers, when pinned to your phone homescreen and anything else. 

The finishing touches on the site should be finished in the next couple of days, then back to writing content! 

Thanks for visiting as always.
