Summary: I've added guides for 6 of the Battlestar Galactica Deadlock ship classes. Each features an overview of the class include stats, turret placement, munitions and more, before taking a look at how it can be used most effectively in engagements. You can take a look [here]({filename}/BSG/ships.md). I'm working on finishing the remainder of the Colonial classes, then moving on to Cylon ships as soon as I can.
